Working:-
Windows to Linux: scp -i ubuntu-key.pem /c/Users/hussa/OneDrive/Documents/demo ubuntu@34.203.216.138:/home/ubuntu/
Linux to windows: scp -r ubuntu@35.172.133.221:/home/ubuntu/demo2.txt /c/Users/hussa/Downloads

Note:- 
Both Need to do from windows itself
From Windows to Linux you need to pass pem key  & 
From Linux to windows you need to generate ssh-keygen in windows & copy that ssh-key, paste in linux instance under authorized keys.
